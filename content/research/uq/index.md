Uncertainty quantification is a critical tool for building trustworthy AI. We consider the following key question:

> **Can we rigorously learn and quantify the uncertainty of AI models, e.g., Large Language Models (LLMs), price predictors, or drones, under distribution shift and adversarial manipulation?**
>


### On-going/Potential Projects

* Improve calibration methods for RL.
* Improve conformal prediction methods for RL. 
* Improve selective prediction methods for RL.
