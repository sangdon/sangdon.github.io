> **Can we rigorously learn and quantify the uncertainty of AI models, e.g., Large Language Models (LLMs), price predictors, or drones, under distribution shift and adversarial manipulation?**
>
Quantified uncertainty of AI models' predictions provides a basis of the trust on predictions.
To rigorously quantify uncertainty, 
we have mainly leveraged learning theory, calibration, and conformal prediction.
