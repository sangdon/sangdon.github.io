Large code models (LCMs) are popularized as large language models (LLMs) are performant. LCMs may be treated as the same way as the LLMs, but we claim that LCMs have its unique **executable property**! Would this unique property helps to build LCMs more functional or vulnerability-free? More precisely, 

> **How to learn large code models (LCMs) that are <mark>functional</mark> (i.e., satisfy user specification) and <mark>free-from vulnerability</mark> by leveraging the executable property of code?**


We leverage traditional static or dynamic program analysis methods, including fuzzing, to specify functional specification (e.g., [arXiv'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13553)). Could we make this better?  



### On-going/Potential Projects

* Align LCMs via RL with unit tests. 
* Learn agentic AI to fix github issues.

Do you have creative ideas in making LCMs better or using LCMs for solving other tasks?
