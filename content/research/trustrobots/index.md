The brain of AI has been replaced by large language models (LLMs). The next challenge (or long-standing challenge) is how to build Physical AI? We attach this challenge by making Physical AI trustworthy. In particular, we consider the following question.     

> **How to build safe robots or humanoids that could live with us and even our kids?**

Based on our previous experiments on trustworthy AI, we build ground breaking learning methods to achieve this goal. 


### On-going/Potential Projects

* **Safe Humanoid Learning**: Learn safe humanoids.
* **Policy Calibration**: Calibrate RL policies.
* **Safe RL with Certification**: Guarantee safety in RL.    
* **Adversarially Robust Policy**: Learn a secure policy from jailbreaking.

What's your own project idea?
