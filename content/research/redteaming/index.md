It is the era of Agentic AI but Agentic AI still suffers from trustworthiness issues, including weakness on jailbreaking. 
We advance the status of Agentic AI by debugging its issues via red teaming. In particular, we consider the following question:

> **How to learn red agentic AI to debug target agentic AI continuously?**
  
We exploit our knowledge and experience on Trustworthy Agentic AI 
to build red Agentic AI for blue Agentic AI.


### On-going/Potential Projects

* Learn red Agents for blue LLMs via RL.  
* Learn continual red teaming Agents.  

Do you have creative ideas in building red Agentic AI?
